## ‚ú®Overview
Adapting large-scale image-text pre-training models, e.g., CLIP, to the video domain represents the current state-of-the-art for text-video retrieval. The primary approaches involve transferring text-video pairs to a common embedding space and leveraging cross-modal interactions on specific entities for semantic alignment. Though effective, these paradigms entail prohibitive computational costs, leading to inefficient retrieval. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, Global-Local Semantic Consistent Learning (GLSCL), which capitalizes on latent shared semantics across modalities for text-video retrieval. Specifically, we introduce a parameter-free global interaction module to explore coarse-grained alignment. Then, we devise a shared local interaction module that employs several learnable queries to capture latent semantic concepts for learning fine-grained alignment. Moreover, we propose an inter-consistency loss and an intra-diversity loss to ensure the similarity and diversity of these concepts across and within modalities, respectively.

## üçÄMethod
Overview of the proposed GLSCL for text-video retrieval. It comprises two main components: (1) Global Interaction Module (GIM) captures coarse-level semantic information among text and video data without involving trainable parameters, and (2) Local Interaction Module (LIM) achieves fine-grained alignment within a shared latent semantic space via several lightweight queries. Furthermore, we introduce an inter-consistency loss and an intra-diversity loss to guarantee consistency and diversity of the shared semantics across and within modalities, respectively.
